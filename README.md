# MoleSpector [In progress]

This is a simple application on React / Express / Python. 

Initially, I worked on this small project as part of a team for our graduation project, which we named "SkinCancerStop." I was responsible for the client side, while two other developers handled the server and the neural network. However, it remained a prototype and never saw the light of day.

Over time, I developed an interest in neural networks and was looking for a project to practice on. I remembered our old prototype and decided to revive it. I removed unnecessary features, rewrote the server, and created a new neural network. Now, it's a refined project that anyone can use. I don't intend to use it commercially or claim the original idea as solely mine. I also renamed the project to distinguish it from the initial prototype, which was a collaborative effort.


## Web usage

Add .env file in the root with following variable and replace PORT to your port of server:

```
