# SkinCancerStop [Stopped]

This is a simple application on React. The main idea was to create a simple application that would allow users to upload images and get a prediction of whether the image contains a mole or not. I created only a client part of this
application, original server used Python + Django, current app has no server and the application doesn't use AI now, so its just a client part.

# Usage

Open "web" folder

Add .env file in the root with following variable and replace PORT to your port of server:

```
REACT_APP_API_URL="http://localhost:PORT"
```

Install the needed packages:

```
npm install
```

Start application:

```
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
